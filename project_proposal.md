## Project Proposal
Jerry Xu and Liang Qiu
### Introduction
  Twitch is a live streaming platform where users are able to livestream themselves playing games, conducting musical broadcasts, or just themselves talking with their viewers. With the COVID-19 pandemic, twitch has seen an influx of new streamers and viewers in the past two years. For this project, we aim to explore the numerous categories and communities that can be found on twitch. Through this exploration, we want to develop and create data visualizations to map how diverse each category or community are. Our main objectives for this project are as the following:
  * Number Of Female streamers and male streamers found within each category
  * Popularity of different languages in each category 

  The reason as to why we decided upon on this topic is because both of us have been users of such platform in the past. With the sudden increase of popularity in twitch, we wanted to revisit twitch and explore the data offered from their API to analyze their demographics while also developing data visualizations (Ex. Graphs, Pie Charts, etc.). 
  
  One outside source in particular that we would be using is twitch tracker. Twitch Tracker is a website where users are able to look at the different statistics found surrounding a streamer. Example of such data that can be found would be streamers’ average viewership, time streamed, and duration of which they are in a certain category. This website also provides us with a better understanding on how we would go about developing data visualizations for this project. Another source we plan on using would be Twitch’s API which would give us access to their data which allows us to explore this topic.

### Methodology
  We will be exploring the gender distribution in the community as well as diversity and growing trend of people coming to this platform. The major topic for this project will be to explain how well does female streamers perform comparing to male streamers. Is there any kind of unequal distribution to female popularities to male popularities in differnt genre. Are there any distinctive characterers that differs between male and female streamers. How does streaming content divide streamer population and how well does the community react to different streamers.

  Some of the tools we will be using is Twitch API, Twitch tracker, as well as examining clips to acquire necessary data. Twitch API is an userful tool to get live images, videos and streamer stats. Twitch tracker is a tool to get streamer status as well as viewr status: viewer counts, channel status. We will also use specific clips to verify and suppliment in our data collection process.
  
  We will be mainly doing numeric as well as text analysis to explore our topics. The project will be divided into couple parts. First, we will look at popularity distribution on the platform in general. Then,we will look into population distribution in different genre and find existing factors that might potentially explain the distribution. We will also be looking into viewer counts between the two group. Additonally, we are thinking to collect some form of viewer chat logs to examine the difference between male and female streamer communities. We will be presenting and analyzing data using tables and baic graphs (line graph, histogram, pie charts...)

### Work Plan

1. Understand the tools we are working with
2. Start the data collection process
3. Clean and organize data
4. Doing data analysis
5. Doing data visualization
6. Explanation and conclusion
7. Further research needed
