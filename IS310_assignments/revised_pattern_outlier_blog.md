## Revised Pattern and Outliers

For today's reading, I found it interesting that you can find special patterns by just analyzing the words. In the article, â€œWhat physical traits are most tied to gender in literature?" by Erin Davis, I see special body parts have certain characteristics being described. I also learned techniques to use computer to understand text, like breaking down sentence and use visualization to represent the text.

I think this area of study is a special one. I didn't usually think there will be that many things to discover in text. I wouldn't normally think to even start studying text. After absorbing today's material, I realized that text or any kind of textual material has potential to be analyzed. There are so many things we normally don't think about that can be discovered from text analysis.
