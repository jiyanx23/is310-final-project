## Crowdsourcing Culture & Managing Metadata

By exploring the DPLA library, I realized the importance of contextual search and the use of "keyword". Metadata is defined to provide context for the data collected. There can also be metadata for the metadata. Without context, we can't pinpoint the exact piece of information we want to retrieve. It's important to have a clear structure for designing the metabase. What should we define, and what should we include. I feel like too much metadata about one piece of information can also cause trouble.

Personally, I don't have many experience with metadata. However, I can see the importance of context among many of the applications. Without metadata, all the information are just numbers or characters. There is no way to analyze data without context.
